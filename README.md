It's like Instagram, but the images are created using AI. The API for doing so comes from [https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0].

It's a social network where users can create the images they want simply by typing a comand. 

The users can share their creations with followers by posting the generated images and adding a description.

The followers can add a like to the images. 

Furthermore, it is possible to exchange messages with other users via chat.
